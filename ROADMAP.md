# exspec Roadmap

## Design Principles

1. **exspec is a static lint + observe tool.** Not a template generator or documentation generator
2. **Solo-dev scope constraint.** Don't pursue 2+ large features in parallel
3. **Ship then iterate.** Don't over-polish before release -- but don't ship broken lint
4. **AI separation.** exspec outputs data; humans/AI decide. exspec itself never calls LLMs

## Now

### v0.4.1 release: small wins + cleanup

Goal: Ship 5 small improvements and release v0.4.1.

| Issue | Task | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| #122 | Document shadow variable limitation in attribute-access query | docs |
| #97 | Add test for multi-level package + same-name module resolve | test |
| #121 | Dotted bare import attribute-access fallback test | test + fix |
| #29 | Rust should_panic: tighten substring match to exact identifier | internal |
| #30 | PHP: align matching style between assertion.scm and error_test.scm | internal |

**Why**: These are all XS-S effort items that improve test coverage, documentation, and internal consistency. Shipping them clears the backlog of quick wins before tackling larger features.

## Next

| Priority | Task | Trigger |
|----------|------|---------|
| P1 | Phase 23b: Helper delegation (1-hop cross-file assertion tracing) | #1 FP source across all languages |
| P2 | Multi-path CLI for observe (B2 cross-package resolution) | 13 FN in NestJS, all B2 |
| P2 | `exspec init` (framework detection + auto-config) | User onboarding friction |
| P2 | Barrel sym-tracking for setup-only import FP | 1 remaining httpx FP |

## Completed Recently

### Phase 24: Python observe Django tests.py support (2026-03-23)

Goal: Recognize Django's `tests.py` naming convention in Python observe.

**Why**: Django uses `tests.py` (exact name) as the standard test file convention. 1669 Django test files were completely invisible to observe because `is_python_test_file` only matched `test_*.py` and `*_test.py`.

**Approach**: 3 touch points: (1) CLI `is_python_test_file` adds `tests.py`, (2) `test_stem` returns parent directory name for `tests.py`, (3) `production_stem` excludes `tests.py`. Layer 2 import tracing handles actual mapping automatically once `tests.py` enters `test_sources`.

### Phase 23a: Same-file helper delegation tracing for Rust (2026-03-23)

Goal: Detect assertions inside helper functions called from test functions within the same file. Rust-only, same-file scope.

**Why**: Helper delegation is the #1 remaining FP source. Phase 23a implements same-file tracing as a first step toward full 1-hop cross-file resolution.

### Phase 22: Rust custom assert macro auto-detection (2026-03-23)

Goal: Automatically recognize `assert_*!` macro invocations as assertions.

**Why**: tokio had 124 FP and clap had 115 FP from custom assertion macros. These were the dominant FP source for Rust T001.

**Results**: tokio BLOCK 385→257 (-128), clap BLOCK 193→71 (-122). Combined -250 FP across 2 projects.

### Phase 21: Python observe re-dogfood + FP fix (2026-03-22)

**Results**: httpx P=98.2%, R=96.8%, F1=97.5%. Ship criteria PASS (P>=98%, R>=90%).

**Decision**: 1 known FP remains (`_models.py <- test_timeouts.py`, setup-only import). Accepted: P=98.2% meets target.

### Phase 10-20: observe improvements (2026-03-18 -- 2026-03-22)

Route extraction (NestJS, FastAPI, Next.js, Django). TS re-dogfood (P=100%, R=91%). Python observe: L1 fixes, barrel import, assertion filter, helper exclusion. Test helper exclusion.

## Backlog

| Priority | Task | Trigger |
|----------|------|---------|
| P2 | T201 spec-quality (advisory mode) | "I want semantic quality checks" |
| P2 | GitHub Action marketplace | After route extraction ships |
| P3 | T203 AST similarity duplicate detection | "I want duplicate test detection" |
| P3 | Go language support (lint) | After observe multi-language proves demand |
| Rejected | LSP/VSCode extension | Too early -- low user count for UI investment |

**Decision: Go language deferred** -- observe multi-language for existing 4 languages takes priority over adding a 5th language to lint. The product differentiator is observe, not language breadth for lint.

**Decision: LSP/VSCode rejection** -- exspec has near-zero external users as of v0.3.0. Building an IDE extension before establishing a user base invests in distribution UX before the core product has proven its value.

## Non-goals

- **Semantic validator**: exspec does not judge whether test names are meaningful or properties are sound
- **Coverage tool**: use lcov/istanbul/coverage.py for that
- **AI reviewer**: no LLM calls, zero API cost
- **Framework-specific linter**: rules should be language-agnostic where possible

## Key Design Decisions

### observe multi-language strategy (Phase 9)

- **ObserveExtractor trait** -- language-agnostic interface in `crates/core/`, each lang crate implements it
- **Two-layer algorithm is portable** -- Layer 1 (filename convention) + Layer 2 (import tracing) applies to all 4 languages
- **Success bar**: Ship criteria P>=98%, R>=90% per language. TypeScript (Phase 11) and Python (Phase 21) are stable. Rust and PHP remain experimental (no formal dogfooding yet)

### B4 barrel fix rejection (Phase 11)

- **Why not fix**: B4 same-package barrel FN is only 2 pairs. Fixing would likely increase FP. Net precision impact: negative.
- **Root cause of FN**: 13/15 FN are B2 (cross-package), not B4. The real fix is multi-path CLI support.

### observe PoC success (Phase 8b-8c, updated Phase 11)

- TypeScript observe validated on NestJS: P=100%, R=91.0% (separate), P=94.1%, R=95.8% (root)
- Static AST-only test-to-code mapping is viable -- no existing tool does this
- Product narrative: "AI generates code -> exspec lint for quality -> exspec observe for gap discovery"

### T001 FP strategy (Phase 6, 4-AI consensus)

- T001 = "oracle-free" detection, not "assert-free"
- Bounded vocabulary approach (not ML)
- Custom helpers: `.exspec.toml` `[assertions] custom_patterns` as escape hatch

### Severity philosophy (Phase 6)

- BLOCK: near-zero false positives required
- WARN: heuristic-based, context-dependent
- INFO: opinionated, may be intentional
- Phase 8a results: T101/T102/T108 demoted WARN->INFO, T106 disabled (93% FP)

### Helper delegation (Phase 8a-4, Phase 23a)

- User-owned config + runtime guidance. No framework-specific knowledge in exspec core
- Phase 23a: same-file helper tracing for Rust (auto-detect assertions in called functions within the same file)
- Phase 23b (next): 1-hop cross-file tracing for all languages
